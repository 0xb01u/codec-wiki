# Aurora1 AV1

Aurora1 AV1 is a proprietary software AV1 encoder developed by [Visionular](https://www.visionular.com/en). Not much is known about this encoder other than rumors that it is supposedly "better" at intra frame compression than open-source encoders, supposedly making it useful for [AVIF](../images/AVIF.mdx) encoding. Take this with a grain of salt, as it is based on some pretty dubious claims including figures provided by the company that are likely cherry-picked.
