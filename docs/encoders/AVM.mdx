# AVM

The AVM video codec is the reference implementation for a future codec from the Alliance for Open Media, the organization behind [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx). From the [Git repo](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/avm):

> AVM (AOM Video Model) is the reference software for next codec from Alliance for Open Media

The codebase is under the Clear BSD license.

The AVM codec is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use. Not much has been documented or tested, though there is some material available.

## Rumors

Some things about the new encoding implementation can be confirmed via the codebase, but none of those changes are final until the codec is standardized and officially released.

Some rumors about the codec include:

- The name of the codec is going to be AV2, superseding AV1
- The codec will be based on AV1, with certain backwards compatibility features available
    - Hardware decoding implementations could be implemented at no cost (no royalties) by utilizing GPU shaders and existing AV1 decoding hardware.
- AOM's strategy will be to release codecs "mid-cycle" relative to ISO/ITU's release schedule, meaning it is likely that "AV2" will compete with [VVC](../video/VVC.mdx), not [ECM](../video/ECM.mdx).
- A quantizer scale of 0-255 will be standard.
- AVM tries to address some issues with high-fidelity AV1 encoding by introducing a better denoiser to mitigate [mosquito noise](../introduction/video-artifacts.mdx#mosquito-noise).
