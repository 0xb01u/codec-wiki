JM is the original [H.264](../video/h264.md) reference encoder, predating alternatives like [x264](../encoders/x264.md). In the modern day, it joins other MPEG reference encoders such as [HM](../encoders/HM.md) & [VTM](../encoders/VTM.md) in their reputations for being highly niche offerings that are used rarely due to their usage complexity & speed disadvantages. x264 is more efficient than JM.
