VTM is the original [H.266](../video/h266.md) (better known as VVC) reference encoder, in competition with alternatives like [VVenC](../encoders/VVenC.md). In the modern day, it joins other MPEG reference encoders such as [HM](../encoders/HM.md) & [JM](../encoders/JM.md) in their reputations for being highly niche offerings that are used rarely due to their usage complexity & speed disadvantages; however, VTM may be more useful due to the current difficulty facing VVC encoding regardless of the encoding implementation one chooses to use. x264 is more efficient than JM.
