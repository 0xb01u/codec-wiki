# uavs3e

[uavs3e](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e/) is an open-source encoder of [AVS3](/docs/video/AVS3) codec. Developed by the Chinese research institutions such as Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Peng Cheng Laboratory and Guangdong Bohua UHD Innovation Corporation.
The encoder itself is updated rarely so bugs and compilation issues may occur. It supports AMD64 with AVX2, ARM with NEON and LoongArch CPUs.

## Installation

### Compiling on Linux
The developers do not ship any pre-built binaries of their encoder so you'll have to compile it yourself.

Windows (VS2017) is also a supported platform although I haven't tested it.

:::caution
Compilation requires GNU Make and CMake
:::

:::caution
As of August 2024 uavs3e doesn't compile with GCC 14. Using Clang 18 instead of GCC works.
:::

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e.git
mkdir build/linux; cd build/linux
cmake ../.. -DCOMPILE_10BIT=0 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
make -j 8
```

:::tip
If you get undefined calls to `close` or `lseek64` functions you need to place the following two lines at the top of `test/utest.c` file.

```c
#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
#include <unistd.h>
```
:::

Binaries will be available in the same folder (`build/linux`), or you can run `make install` on Linux to install (May need elevated permissions).

### 10-bit Support

You need to set `-DCOMPILE_10BIT=1` in CMake command for 10 bit support however the encoder compiled with this flag was [segfaulting on my system](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e/issues/53).

## Usage

The encoder can't parse `.y4m` files so they need to be converted to raw video (`.yuv`).

```bash title="Simple 8-bit FHD 23.976 fps input with QP 20 and raw avs3 bitstream output"
uavs3enc -i input.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -d 8 --fps_num 24000 --fps_den 1001 -q 20 -o output.avs3
```

```bash title="Speed 2, CRF 20, intra period 120, multithreaded"
uavs3enc -i input.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -d 8 --fps_num 24000 --fps_den 1001 -p 120 --wpp_threads 8 --frm_threads 8 --speed_level 2 --rc_type 1 -q 20 -o output.avs3
```

uave3e currently [does not support](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e/issues/2) piping.

## Notes

1. Usable speed presets range from 0 to 4 where 0 is the slowest and 4 is the fastest one.
2. The encoder can actually be quite competitive even with newest [AV1](/docs/video/av1) and [VVC](/docs/video/vvc) encoders in terms of visual fidelity.
3. `uavs3d` can be used to decode output bitstream. If you want realtime playback, you need to have [FFmpeg](/docs/utilities/ffmpeg) with `--enable-libuavs3d` compiled.
