# Kvazaar

[Kvazaar](https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar) is an open-source [H.265 / HEVC](/docs/video/HEVC) software encoder Written in C, developed by [Ultra Video Group](https://ultravideo.fi/) and licensed under BSD 3-clause. 

[uvg266](/docs/encoders/uvg266) (Developed by the same group) uses Kvazaar as base for encoding to the [VVC](/docs/video/VVC) codec.

:::info
It is recommended to use [x265](/docs/encoders/x265) instead as it performs much better in both quality and speed.
:::

## FFmpeg

Kvazaar is available in FFmpeg via ``libkvazaar``, to check if you have it, run ``ffmpeg -h encoder=libkvazaar``. You can input non-FFmpeg standard Kvazaar parameters via ``-kvazaar-params``.

You may need to download "Full" builds. As most of the time, this encoder is not included.


## Supported Color Space

Kvazaar supports the following color spaces:

| Format           | Chroma Subsampling | Supported Bit Depth(s) |
|------------------|:------------------:|-----------------------|
| YUV420P          | 4:2:0              | 8-bit                 |
| YUV420P10LE      | 4:2:0              | 10-bit                |


## Installation

### Arch Linux

Kvazaar is available on both pacman (`kvazaar`) and the Arch User Repository (AUR) as `kvazaar-git`.

### Compiling

Ultra Video Group does not ship any pre-built binaries of their encoders except for their [AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Ultravideo/kvazaar), but AppVeyor deletes build artifacts after a month, so most of the time you'll have to compile Kvazaar yourself. 

Windows users are recommended to compile via MinGW-W64 which comes with [MSYS2](https://msys2.org/). Please be advised **the usage of Clang for compiling in this situation is heavily recommended**
due to disabled AVX2 optimizations because of a known GCC issue from 2012 (MinGW environments-exclusive). To do this, run `CC=clang ./configure` during autoconf.

:::caution
Compilation requires GNU Automake, Autoconf, Libtool, and M4.
:::

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar.git
cd kvazaar
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j$(nproc)
```

Binaries will be available in `src`, or you can run `make install` on Linux to install (May need elevated permissions).

### Using CMake for 10-bit support

You will need to use CMake to specify a flag to be able to encode 10-bit with the encoder, by default Kvazaar ships with only 8-bit.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar.git
cd kvazaar/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DKVZ_BIT_DEPTH=10"
make -j$(nproc)
```
:::warning
Encoding 10-bit with Kvazaar is significantly slower as the developers only prioritized SIMD optimizations for 8-bit, and can get quite buggy.

## Usage

```bash title="Simple Y4M input with QP 20 and raw 265 bitstream output"
kvazaar -i input.y4m --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 -o output.265
```

```bash title="Preset slow, CRF 20, Y4M input"
kvazaar -i input.y4m --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 --preset slow -o output.265
```

```bash title="FFmpeg piping"
ffmpeg -v error -i input.mkv -f yuv4mpegpipe -strict -1 - | kvazaar -i - --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 --preset slow -o output.265
```
