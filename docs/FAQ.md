# FAQ

## Why are you doing this?

Because nobody else is doing it, years after years after years. Multimedia Wiki is just dead, ``guide.encode.moe`` is stagnant and mostly focused on fansub, docs and personal experiences that are scattered around the internet, and poorly ("The documentation is the code") to nonexistent documented filters

doesn't help either how steep the learning curve for encoding is.


## Why not use MediaWiki?

Not modern enough, the goal is to attract zoomers with fancy animations and eye candy.
