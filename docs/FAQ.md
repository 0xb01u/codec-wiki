# FAQ

## Why are you doing this?

Because nobody else is doing it, and I am sick of scouring through code for "Documentation".


## Why not use MediaWiki?

Not modern enough, the goal is to attract zoomers with fancy animations and eye candy.


## Why is the domain "x266.mov"?

Most people are familiar with the x26* lineup, and I wanted to grab ``x265.mov`` instead but some camper took it on the day I am going to buy it (It was available before)


## Are you associated with MPEG/MulticoreWare?

no.
