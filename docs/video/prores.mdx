# ProRes

ProRes is a family of lossy video compression codecs developed by Apple Inc. ProRes is designed to serve as a high-quality "visually lossless" video editing codec that offers superior image quality compared to many other editing codecs while still maintaining a relatively compact file size compared to uncompressed video.

ProRes is based on technology licensed from the discontinued Prism video codec developed by a company named Prism Multimedia. Apple acquired the rights to Prism in 2003 and rebranded an adapted version as ProRes in 2007 with the release of Final Cut Pro 6.

ProRes uses 10-bit 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling depending on the specific flavor. This provides greater color fidelity and precision than typical 8-bit 4:2:0 codecs like H.264. ProRes employs inter-frame coding, with periodic keyframes for random access.

The compression uses wavelet transformations and lightweight temporal compression techniques. This allows ProRes to achieve very high quality video with relatively low data rates around 100-400 Mbps depending on the resolution and specific ProRes variant.

## Format Breakdown
There are multiple variants of ProRes that offer different combinations of image quality and compression ratios:

- ProRes 4444 XQ: 4:4:4 chroma, up to 500 Mbps
- ProRes 4444: 4:4:4 chroma, up to 330 Mbps  
- ProRes HQ: 4:2:2 chroma, up to 184 Mbps
- ProRes: 4:2:2 chroma, up to 102 Mbps
- ProRes LT: 4:2:2 chroma, up to 68 Mbps
- ProRes Proxy: 4:2:2 chroma, up to 45 Mbps

The higher data rate variants like 4444 XQ and HQ prioritize maximum quality at the expense of larger file sizes. The lower data rate variants trade off some quality for much smaller file sizes suitable for editing on portable devices.

## Usage
ProRes has become widely adopted in professional video post-production workflows due to its quality, performance, metadata handling, and tight integration with Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software and ecosystem.

ProRes is supported by most major non-linear editing systems beyond just Final Cut Pro, including Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer, and others. This cross-platform compatibility makes it a convenient codec for exchange between different video editing applications.

While designed primarily as an editing codec, Apple has also implemented hardware acceleration for ProRes decoding and encoding in recent Mac computers and Apple Silicon chips. This hardware acceleration enables higher performance for tasks like playback, transcoding, and export compared to software-only implementations.
