"VapourSynth is an application for video manipulation. Or a plugin. Or a library. Itâ€™s hard to tell because it has a core library written in C++ and a Python module to allow video scripts to be created."

-- Fredrik Mellbin, creator of VapourSynth

## Lore

VapourSynth is supposed to be an upgrade and 21st century rewrite for [Avisynth](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page), created by Ben Rudiak-Gould, Edwin van Eggelen, Klaus Post, Richard Berg and Ian Brabham in May 2000. One of the most attractive feature from the full rewrite is better multithreading which Avisynth suffered a lot from due to it's very old infrastructure, despite this some Avisynth veterans refuse to move over because they're already used to their workflow (There is nothing inheritly wrong with this, you do you).
