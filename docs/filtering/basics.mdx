# Basics of Filtering with Vapoursynth

## Intro to Filters

In order to do filtering, we are going to need some filters. Vapoursynth includes some basic filters, but there are a lot more useful filters
built by the community that can be incredibly useful to us.

For example, we are going to make use of some of the functions in [vs-tools](https://github.com/Jaded-Encoding-Thaumaturgy/vs-tools).
If you are on Arch, the recommended way to install this is via the AUR, using the `vapoursynth-plugin-vstools-git` package.
For other operating systems, it is simpler to install all of the JET plugins at once, using the [vs-jet utility](https://github.com/Jaded-Encoding-Thaumaturgy/vs-jet).
Note that these do require Python, which you should already have installed if you've installed Vapoursynth. You may have noticed in the previous section
that all Vapoursynth scripts use Python syntax. It is not necessary to know Python in order to write Vapoursynth scripts, although it can be helpful
for some more advanced techniques.

## Filter Order

Order matters when applying filters to a video. There are certain actions that must be taken at the very start, and certain actions that are better to be done
later in a filter chain. The following image shows a recommended order for many of the most common filter actions:

If this seems a bit complicated at first, that's okay. We will learn about each of these steps one at a time, and when
each of these filters might be needed.

## Bit Depth and Colorimetry

In most cases, the first action we want to take on a video is to ensure the correct [matrix, primaries, and transfer characteristics](../colorimetry/intro.mdx) are set, and convert the video to 16-bit.
The colorimetry properties are important for ensuring accurate colors, and 16-bit helps filters to work in higher quality and create fewer artifacts.

The currently recommended way to handle this is with the `vstools.initialize_clip` function. This function will handle both ensuring that colorimetry is set, and converting to 16-bit with appropriate dithering if needed.
We can add it to a script in the following way:

```python
import vapoursynth as vs
core = vs.core
clip = core.lsmas.LWLibavSource(source="myinput.mkv")

import vstools
clip = vstools.initialize_clip(clip)

clip.set_output(0)
```

If the video has existing colorimetry data set on it, `initialize_clip` will keep the existing data. Otherwise, it will assume colorimetry based on the video resolution.
Usually, those assumptions will be correct. However, there may be cases where we know that the assumptions are incorrect, and we need to set them manually.
For example, we may have a 4k video that we know was upscaled from a 1080p video, and we want to force BT.709 colorimetry. In that case, we can specify the properties to `initialize_clip`,
and it will use the properties we specify instead of making guesses.

```python
from vstools import Primaries, Matrix, Transfer
clip = vstools.initialize_clip(clip, primaries=Primaries.BT709, matrix=Matrix.BT709, transfer=Transfer.BT709)
```
