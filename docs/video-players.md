# Video Players

Many different players exist for video, but here are a few recommended ones:

## MPV

MPV is a open source lightweight media player. It is intended as a command-line application, making it's user interface extremely minimal, however, many frontends exist for mpv, giving a more complete GUI, such as Celluloid and IINA. It has wide codec and container support.
