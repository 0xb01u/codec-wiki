JPEG-XL is a compression format for images that was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) in 2020. It is designed to provide improved compression efficiency compared to the traditional [JPEG](./JPEG.md) format, while still maintaining image quality. JPEG-XL uses a combination of techniques such as perceptual color encoding, advanced entropy coding, and a new image prediction method to achieve its improved compression performance.
