# Codecs
Codecs, shortened from **coder-decoders**, are a system for encoding and decoding data. Image codecs convert the color channels, (often Red, Green, and Blue) into a stream of bits that can be turned back into a sequence of Red, Green, and Blue at the other end.

## Compression
Codecs can be uncompressed, where they encode the data as-is, or compressed, where it tries to encode in a smaller representation than the original form.
## Lossy and Lossless
Within compression, there is the further distiction between lossy and lossless compression. Lossless compression can be reversed to the exact same as the input data. Lossy compression throws out some of the data, resulting in a smaller compressed form.
