SSIMULACRA 2 is a visual fidelity metric based on the concept of the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), computed in a perceptually relevant color space, adding two other (asymmetric) error maps, and aggregating using two different norms. It is currently the most reputable visual quality metric according to its correlation with subjective results, and is considered a very robust means of comparing encoders. It is debatable whether [Butteraugli](../metrics/butteraugli.mdx) is better for very high fidelity, but SSIMULACRA 2 is considered the best for medium/low fidelity comparisons. Although it does not feature any inter-frame temporal awareness, it is still considered a very strong metric for video fidelity comparison nonetheless.

While a [reference implementation by Cloudinary](https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra2) exists,
most people will want to use [the rust implementation `ssimulacra2_rs`](https://github.com/rust-av/ssimulacra2).

## Installing

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cargo" label="Cargo" default>
        To install ssimulacra2_rs using cargo, run this:
        ```bash
        cargo install ssimulacra2_rs
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="archlinux" label="Archlinux AUR">
        On archlinux, you may use the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) to install.
        Simply use your favorite AUR helper to install `ssimulacra2_bin-git`

        ```bash
        paru -S ssimulacra2_bin-git
        ```
    </TabItem>

## Running
### On Images
Comparing images is simple, run this:
```bash
ssimulacra2_rs image source.png distorted.png
```

### On Videos

If you want to compare videos, run this:
```bash
ssimulacra2_rs video source.mkv distorted.mkv
```

:::tip Graphical visualization
You can optionally output a graph using the `-g` parameter:
```bash
ssimulacra2_rs video source.mkv distorted.mkv -g
```

#### Multithreading
Multithreading with ssimulacra2_rs works, but it scales badly.
This is likely due to memory bandwidth limitations.
However, the speedup is worth it.

To run multithreaded, use the `--frame-threads` or `-f` parameters.
For example, to run with 16 threads:
```bash
ssimulacra2_rs video source.mkv distorted.mkv -f 16
```
:::info Thread amount
You should set the amount of threads to half of your actual thread count, as going any higher won't make a difference.

:::warning Memory limitation
If you have a small amount of system memory, you may encounter out of memory errors while running with multi-threading.
If that's the case, you need to lower the amount of threads. 
:::
#### Frame skipping
SSIMULACRA 2 is, at its core, an image quality assessment metric, not a video quality one.
This means that it does not use any temporal information when applied to videos; just the independent scores of each individual frame.
Consequently, it can be applied to a subset of a video's frames, instead of to all of them, to obtain a meaningful estimate of the score in a reduced time.

To run ssimulacra2_rs with frame skip enabled, use the `--increment` or `-i` parameters.
For example, to compute the score for every 3rd frame:
```bash
ssimulacra2_rs video source.mkv distorted.mkv -i 3
```

:::info Frame skip amount
To avoid biased score estimates, it is recommended to sample frames using an odd value as increment.
Prime numbers further reduce the likelihood of sampling bias.
Thus increments of 3, 5, 7, 11 or 13 frames are good options to compute score estimates with little deviation to the true score.

In any case, powers of two (2, 4, 8, 16...) should be avoided as increment, due to the way video encoders deal with temporal layers.

## Scoring
The score that SSIMULACRA 2 outputs is simple: a number in range -inf..100. According to the developers of the metric, for image quality assessment, SSIMULACRA 2 scores correlate to subjective visual quality as follows:

- Very high quality: `90` and above
- High quality: `70` to `90`
- Medium quality: `50` to `70`
- Low quality: Below `50`

For video quality assessment, however, the scores need not be as high for similar subjective visual quality correlation.
For example, it is believed that an average score of around `80` corresponds to a "visually lossless" video.
Nevertheless, this has not been thoroughly verified.
