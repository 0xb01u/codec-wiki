  "description": "A video container is a digital file format that holds video and audio data, as well as additional information such as subtitles, metadata, and chapter markers. It acts as a \"wrapper\" that packages all these elements into a single file that can be played on various devices and software platforms. Think of it like a container you might use to transport goods - the video and audio data are like the items being transported, while the container itself provides a structure and organization for the contents.",
